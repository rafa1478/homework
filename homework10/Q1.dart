/*Design an OOP model for planning trip fuel across multiple vehicle types.
 Requirements:- Provide a general vehicle type with encapsulated core data (private fields) and validated constructors
 (invalid â†’ print an error; keep previous values).- Create at least two specialized vehicle types that inherit from the general type and introduce one
 private field each affecting fuel usage, with validation.- Define a fuel computation method in the general type; specialized types must override it with their own
 rule.- In a mixed collection of vehicles, given a list of trip distances, compute total fuel per vehicle and print
 which vehicles cannot complete the route under their own constraints (you define the constraint per
 type). */
